amzmg: Amazon MP3 Getter for Linux

Currently pretty barebones, but already potentially useful to some, this python script monitors an Amazon account for new music purchases and automatically downloads them to a specified location.

Immediate enhancements needed: add daemon mode. Perfectly workable as a one-off downloader, or in a screen session, or left running in the background long-term as well.

On first run, the script will ask a few setup questions like where to download the music to.
