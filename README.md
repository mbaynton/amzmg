amzmg: Amazon MP3 Getter for Linux

Currently pretty barebones, but already potentially useful to some, this python script monitors an Amazon account for new music purchases and automatically downloads them to a specified location.

Immediate inhancements needed: automatically reauthenticate after cookies expire, add daemon mode. Perfectly workable as a one-off downloader already though.

On first run, the script will ask a few setup questions like where to download the music to.
